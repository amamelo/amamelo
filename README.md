I am an adaptable, creative and persistent software engineer with a passion for problem solving, learning new technologies and programming languages to create innovative software and user experiences.  I enjoy finding pain points and opportunities to continuously develop and improve the world around me. 

My recent projects have allowed me to use a variety of programming languages such as Python, JavaScripts, SQL, HTML5 and CSS, in addition to frontend and backend frameworks, and system design technologies including, Django 4, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. Throughout the years I have learned the significance of adaptability on the path to expanding and achieving one’s goals. I have had to adapt to new environments, schedules, deadlines, client’s requests, and the initial discomfort of discovering the unknown to learn something new. Throughout my journey from designer to Software Engineer, I’ve not only adopted new skills, but learned to be tenacious in converting dreams into functioning, ever-improving realities. 

When I’m not working, you can find me jumping rope, baking pies and learning to roller skate.
